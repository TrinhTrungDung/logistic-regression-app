# Compulsory Elective Subject - Logistic Regression

Let's do some statistics (Yeah). The name says it all. Math sux

# Report Outline
Abstract, table of contents and referencing will be included in the final report but not in the outline. The structure can of course be discussed and varied.
## I. Core Funtionalities
1. Method
    * Preparation (Cleaning)
        + Categorizing variables (Supplied by the png) & interpretation
        + Clear unecessary data
        + Handle missing values
    * Logistic Analysis
        + Assumptions
        + Components (Random, systematic, link)
        + Mathematical formulation of the problem instance
    * Implementation in R (Code walkthrough)
2. Findings
    * Results derived from data set (model description)
        + Optimal
        + Reduced (Production)
    * Tests
        + Hosmer - Lemeshow statistics
        + McFadden Pseudo R^2
        + ANOVA - Deviance Residual Analysis
3. Criticism
    * Probit as Link
    * vs Linear Discriminant Analysis
